        <h1>Simple system having one sole goal</h1>

<p>As web developer I used many frameworks mainly because my employer required it. However with stuff like Symphony 2  and Doctrine I felt lose of controlover some stuff especialy how DB conection is handled. So I decided to create system that allows to have simple ORM Layer. Since this ORM have its loging feature for failed loads etc I decided to build in simple loging to DB table consiting of id and log msg. Making login kinda universal so the log static class and method is exposed for you to use what you do with log tables is up to you. Logs are human timestamped and every day has its own table.</p>

<p>At present only one DB connection is supported and only MySQL DB since I am using it in specific project with closed source. However in future I plan to update it so it uses odbc thus making it compatible with all SQL DB systems and I plan to add multiple connections support(its mostly matter of simple modification)</p>
